Description: Provides imbalance scores for each possible treatment group as a new subject enters the clinical trial study by Dynamic Allocation. The treatment allocation probability for each group is calculated and a final group allocation is returned. This package supports three Dynamic Allocation procedures and a final function that wraps all the functions into one. This Dynamic Allocation scheme is an unbalance minimization method proposed by Lebowitsch et al.(2012) <doi: 10.1002/sim.5418>.
